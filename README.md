This project is based on Irene Sainz's TFG titled: "Nociception Monitors: A comparision based on different clinical cases". 

The objective of nociception monitors in surgeries is to more precisely and objectively control the level of pain and ensure that the patient is receiving the correct amount of anesthesia and analgesia during the surgery to minimize the pain and stress associated with the procedure. These noninvasive monitors are an important tool for pain control and monitoring of anesthetic depth during surgeries, and can help reduce the risk of postoperative complications and improve patient satisfaction. [2]

"Monitoring nociception remains a challenge in attempts to lower the incidence of acute postoperative pain and the move towards a more automated approach to analgesia and anaesthesia." [3]

So the aim of Irene`s TFG is to compare different nociception techniques, based on clinical cases, in order to assess their perfomances and finish with the lack of trust with devices' indices. [1]
